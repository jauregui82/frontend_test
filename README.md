# My test summary

For this test I used the folder structure we developed in my current work, which allows us to have the `Redux` and `Models` separated from the components for a better understanding of the code.

Use `Material-UI` as support for components and styles in css and jss

Use `Redux` to keep some of the component states and also for props

All the components are functional and none of class, as well as the call to `Redux` using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`

Also use `Eslint` to keep the code indented

## Getting started

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Open test `cypress` from chrome:

```bash
$ npm run cypress
```
Open test `cypress` from console:
